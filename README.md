BitGo Command-Line Interface (bitgo-cli)
=========

# Summary
This package provides a NodeJS program (**bitgo**), which is a (mostly) complete command-line interface to [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com) wallets. It also contains some useful client-side-only commands for key generation.

# Installation

**NodeJS must be installed as a prerequisite.**
```sh
$ npm install -g bitgo-cli
```

# Running

Running **bitgo -h** will produce usage information.

```sh
$ bitgo -h
usage: bitgo [-h] [-v] [-t]

# Testnet

By default, **bitgo** will use the production Bitcoin network, and will authenticate
with **www.bitgo.com**. In order to use BitGo's testnet environment at **test.bitgo.com**, either use the **-t** flag on the command line, or set the following environment variable:
```sh
$ export BITGO_NETWORK=testnet
```
The testnet environment is a completely separate namespace from the BitGo production database. You will need to set up separate accounts on [test.bitgo.com](https://test.bitgo.com/) for testing purposes.  Note that in the test environment, while standard Authy codes still work for 2FA, it is also possible to use a code of 0000000 (7 zeroes).

# Sessions
The tool maintains one current login session per network (prod or testnet). The sessions are persisted in JSON format files in **~/.bitgo**.  Each session maintains the user's current auth token, and maintains a current wallet. All of the commands that operate on a wallet use this current wallet context. In order to operate on a different wallet, it must first be selected using the **wallet** command.


# Commands

### A Note on Command-Line Options
Many of the commands have interactive flows, prompting for needed information as they go. Generally, these interactive prompts can be bypassed by providing the corresponding information through a command-line flag.

## login
Authenticate with BitGo, establishing a session.
```sh
$ bitgo login
Email: user@domain.com
Password: ********
2-Step Verification Code: 0000000
*** Logged in as user@domain.com
...
```

## logout
Logout of the current session. Sessions expire in 60 minutes by default.
```sh
$ bitgo logout
```

## token
Show the current auth token:
```sh
$ bitgo token
bab7b73dec9501b8b210ec8d68e1ac26a88b7b8c3c4f6811935d793d627c7d54
```
Set the current auth token; this is an alternate way of changing sessions, or can be used to install a long-lived API token provided by BitGo:
```sh
$ bitgo -t token 24b7b73dec9501b8b210ec8d68e1ac26a88b7b8c3c4f6811935d793d627c7d54
*** Logged in as user@domain.com
```

## status
Show the current session status.
```sh
$ bitgo status
Network: prod
Session file: ~/.bitgo/prod.json
Current User: user@domain.com
Logged in
Current wallet: 3N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao
```

## wallets
List the wallets available to the user, with balances. Indicates which wallet is currently selected.
```sh
$ bitgo wallets
```

## wallet
Get or set the current wallet.
```sh
$ bitgo wallet          # shows current wallet information
$ bitgo wallet 3        # selects wallet 3 in the wallets list
$ bitgo wallet <addr>   # selects wallet by address
$ bitgo wallet <name>   # selects wallet by name
```

## labels
Show address labels associated with the current wallet, or all wallets.
```sh
$ bitgo labels        # shows address labels on current wallet
$ bitgo labels -a     # shows address labels on all wallets
```

## setlabel
Label a Bitcoin address in the context of the current wallet.
```sh
$ bitgo setlabel <address> "My label here"
```

## removelabel
Remove label from a Bitcoin address in the context of the current wallet.
```sh
$ bitgo removelabel <address>
```

## addresses
Show receive addresses for the current wallet, and optionally change addresses. Shows
```sh
$ bitgo addresses           # show receive addresses only
$ bitgo addresses -c        # include change addresses
```

## newaddress
Generate a new receive address for the current wallet
```sh
$ bitgo newaddress
*** Created new receive address: 3NCsnZpdioF5ZCmnuSyzeb8nH4Rp4XRzdu1
```

## unspents
Show a list of unspents on the current wallet, optionally filtering by minimum confirms.
```sh
$ bitgo unspents            # show all unspents
$ bitgo unspents -c 6       # show unspents with at least 6 confirms
```

## tx
List transactions on the current wallet.
```sh
$ bitgo tx                  # show last 25 transactions
$ bitgo tx -n 100           # show last 100 transactions
```

## unlock
In order to transact, a BitGo session must first be unlocked, by providing an additional
2-step verification (Authy) code. The **send** command handles prompting for this automatically, but the
wallet can also be unlocked explicitly.
```sh
$ bitgo unlock 1234567     # unlock the session with current Authy code
*** Unlocked session
```

## lock
Explicitly lock the session, preventing further transactions from taking place.
```sh
$ bitgo lock
*** Locked session
```

## send
Send a transaction. This command provides a guided flow, but the needed info may also be provided on the command line.
```sh
$ bitgo -t send       # note, this is Testnet (due to the -t)
Current wallet: 2N9VaC4SDRNNnEy6G8zLF8gnHgkY6LV9PsX
Send Transaction:

Destination address: 2N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao
Amount (in BTC): 0.5
Wallet passcode: ********************
Optional comment: paying Mike for lunch
Please confirm sending BTC 0.5000 + 0.0001 blockchain fee to 2N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao
Type 'go' to confirm: go
2-step Verification Code: 0000000
*** Unlocked session
*** Sent transaction 9ef2042647ceb0b1ec8f18733ab46d11c330b4449549fe37a9c559e170806d0e
```

## newkey
Create a new BIP32 root key. This is a client-side only operation. It does not require the user to be authenticated with BitGo, and does not contact the BitGo server.  Additional entropy may be provided on the command line.
```sh
$bitgo newkey
*** Created new BIP32 keychain

```

## newwallet
Create a new BitGo HD 2-of-3 Multi-sig wallet. This is a guided flow with instructions. You will need to provide 1 xprv and 1 xpub, or 2 xpubs in order to create the wallet.

**Please be aware that creating a wallet in this manner does not produce a recovery KeyCard. You are fully responsible for backing up your keys. If you lose access to your keys and passcode, BitGo cannot help you recover your funds.**

```sh
$ bitgo -t newwallet
Current User: ben+0@bitgo.com
Create New Wallet undefined

First, we need the user keychain. Enter a BIP32 xprv below, or press
return to generate one automatically. Your user key is encrypted locally
with your password, and stored on BitGo's server.

User key (xprv or xpub): xprv9s21ZrQH143K4VhG7qJD...

Next, we need the backup keychain. Enter a BIP32 xpub below. It is recommended
to generate the backup keychain on a different machine using reliable
BIP32 key generation software. For instance, you can use the 'keychain'
sub-command to generate a keychain

Backup key (xpub): xpub661MyMwAqRbcG7xHfBQqNLMNS...
Name this wallet: My Command Line Wallet
Enter BitGo password: ********************
*** Created wallet 2N3So1bs9fuLeA3MrsBGPmkaYMXGWQn1HWG
```

## shell
Launch the BitGo shell, which simply allows you to run commands without prefixing them with **bitgo**. No other shell functionality is provided. Use Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D to exit.
```sh
bitgo -t shell
[bitgo @ My Cool Wallet]à¸¿ status
```

## splitkeys
This is a client-side utility command which assists in generating a batch of BIP32 keys which are split
using Shamir Secret Sharing, and have the shares encrypted with separate passwords (each
known by a separate person, generally).  It provides a guided flow, as well as command-line args.
```sh
$ splitkeys -h
usage: bitgo splitkeys [-h] [-m M] [-n N] [-N NKEYS] [-p PREFIX] [-e ENTROPY]

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -m M                  number of shares required to reconstruct a key
  -n N                  total number of shares per key
  -N NKEYS, --nkeys NKEYS
                        total number of keys to generate
  -p PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                        output file prefix
  -e ENTROPY, --entropy ENTROPY
                        additional user-supplied entropy
```

# recoverkeys
A client-side utility for recovering keys generated by splitkeys.
```sh
$bitgo recoverkeys -h
usage: bitgo recoverkeys [-h] [-f FILE] [-k KEYS]

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -f FILE, --file FILE  the input file (JSON format)
  -k KEYS, --keys KEYS  comma-separated list of key indices to recover
```
